# The [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md)

If you want your list to be included on `awesome`, try to only include actual awesome stuff in your list. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

But **what is awesome?**

## Only awesome is awesome

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.
